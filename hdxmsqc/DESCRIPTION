Description: The hdxmsqc package enables us to analyse and visualise the quality
 of HDX-MS experiments. Either as a final quality check before downstream
 analysis and publication or as part of a interative procedure to determine
 the quality of the data. The package builds on the QFeatures and Spectra
 packages to integrate with other mass-spectrometry data.
